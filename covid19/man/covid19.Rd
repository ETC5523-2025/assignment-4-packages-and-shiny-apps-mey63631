\item{R0}{integer, basic reproductive ratio: the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected person in a completely susceptible population.}
\item{VE}{numeric, vaccine efficacy, representing reduction in susceptibility to infection.}
\item{Value}{numeric, relative force of infection produced by quarantine breaches.}
}

\description{
Simulated outcomes of quarantine breach events under different scenarios of
basic reproductive ratio (R0) and vaccine efficacy (VE). Used to explore how
the relative force of infection changes with R0 and VE.
