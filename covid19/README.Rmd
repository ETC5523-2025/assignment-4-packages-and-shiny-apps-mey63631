# covid19: Visualising COVID-19 Quarantine Breach Scenarios

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


The covid19 package provides simulation data, visualization tools, and an interactive Shiny app to explore COVID-19 quarantine breach scenarios.
It helps users understand how different vaccine efficacy levels (VE) and basic reproductive ratios (R0) influence the relative force of infection, allowing exploration of potential outbreak risks under various scenarios.
The package and app are inspired by Zachreson et al. (2022).

## Installation

You can install the development version of covid19 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-mey63631", subdir = "covid19")

```

## 📘 Package website
The pkgdown website for this package is available at:  
[https://ETC5523-2025.github.io/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-mey63631/](https://ETC5523-2025.github.io/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-mey63631/)


## Dataset

The `covid19` dataset contains simulated relative force of infection values for combinations of R0 (basic reproductive ratio) and VE (vaccine efficacy).  

- **R0:** Basic reproductive ratio (1–10)  
- **VE:** Vaccine efficacy (0–0.9)  
- **Value:** Relative force of infection  

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(covid19)

# View first rows of the dataset
head(covid19)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(covid19)
```
Using README.Rmd instead of a static README.md allows you to include live R code chunks.
These chunks are executed when the README is built, showing real data, plots, and outputs directly on GitHub.
