# covid19

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Interactive Shinny app to explore COVID-10 quarantine breach risk under different basic Reproductive Ratio (R0) scenarios. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of covid19 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-mey63631", subdir = "covid19")

```

## 📘 Package website
The pkgdown website for this package is available at:  
[https://ETC5523-2025.github.io/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-mey63631/](https://ETC5523-2025.github.io/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-mey63631/)


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(covid19)
## basic example code

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
